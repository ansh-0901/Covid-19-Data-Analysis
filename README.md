# Impact Analysis of COVID 19 on AQI
This project involves exploratory data analysis of air pollutants amidst the corona virus pre and post lockdown in various Indian cities.
Datasets are downloaded from the following website: https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/
There are many pollutants present in the atmosphere that causes air pollution but in this project I am majorily focusing on 3 major pollutants:
1. Particulate matter -> Particulate matter is a mix of solids and liquids, including carbon, complex organic chemicals, sulphates, nitrates, mineral dust, and water suspended in the air. PM varies in size. Some particles, such as dust, soot, dirt or smoke are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. But the most damaging particles are the smaller particles, known as PM2.5. Worldwide exposure to PM 2.5 contributed to 4.1 million deathsfrom heart disease and stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and respiratory infections in 2016. 
2. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) -> Nitrogen Dioxide is a reddish-brown gas with a pungent, acrid odour. It can cause bronchoconstriction, inflammation, reduced immune response, and may have effects on the heart. Direct exposure to the skin can cause irritations and burns.
The following gives a rough idea of nitrogen dioxide’s impact on health :
              - 10–20 ppm can cause mild irritation of the nose and throat
              - 25–50 ppm can cause oedema leading to bronchitis or pneumonia
              - Levels above 100 ppm can cause death due to asphyxiation from fluid in the lungs.
3. Sulphur Dioxide(SO2) -> Sulphur Dioxide is a gas. It is one of the major pollutants present in the air. It is colourless and has a nasty, sharp smell. It combines effortlessly with other chemicals to form harmful substances like sulphuric acid, sulfurous acid, etc.
